### Course Description

CMSC451 is an upper-level course focused on the design and analysis of algorithms. The course presents fundamental techniques for designing efficient algorithms, proving their correctness, and analyzing their performance. Topics we will cover include:

- Computational models and resources
- Hashing and randomness
- Graph algorithms
- Flows and linear programs
- Online algorithms
- Approximation algorithms
- Computational intractability

You will also learn how to implement algorithms efficiently in practice as part of this course, using some tools from the competitive programming world.

**Prerequisites:**
You should be comfortable with algorithm design and analysis (e.g., you should be comfortable with the material from CMSC351).
Prior experience implementing some basic algorithms and data structures is helpful.

### Grading

Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. You can submit homeworks
up to four days late, with a 5% penalty per day. Late homeworks will
not be accepted beyond four days so that we can release solutions in a
timely manner.

We will first assign you a numerical score [0, 1] that satisfies the following:

**max** {(hw x hwscore) + (midterm x midtermscore) + (final x finalscore)} such that <br>
{0.1 <= midterm <= 0.3}, <br>
{0.1 <= hw <= 0.7}, <br>
{0.1 <= final <= 0.6}, and <br>
{hw + midterm + final = 1}

hwscore, midtermscore, and finalscore are your raw scores for each of
these categories in [0, 1]. The homework score will be computed by
summing up the points and dividing by the total (and ignoring the
dropped homework).

Basically we will find the best multipliers to maximize your score,
subject to the constraints above and calculate your raw number grade.
The cutoffs to turn this into a letter grade may then be adjusted
(only more generously) to assign your final letter grade.


### Academic Accomodations for Disabilities

Any student eligible for and requesting reasonable academic accommodations due to a disability is requested to provide, to the instructor in office hours, a letter of accommodation from the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) within the first two weeks of the semester.


### Our Pledge to the Students

Your education is very important to us, and we respect each of you regardless of how you do in the class. Our expectations of you are that you attend class and pay full attention, and give enough time to the course. We strongly encourage you to ask questions in class, and to come to the office hours (the instructors’ or the TAs’) with any further questions. We can have a very enjoyable educational experience if you pay attention in class, give sufficient time to our course, and bring any difficulties you have promptly to our attention. We look forward to our interaction both inside and outside the classroom.
